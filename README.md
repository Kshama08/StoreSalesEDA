# StoreSalesEDA
We are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. 
The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. 
These markdowns precede prominent holidays. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

The Task:
	
Predict the department-wide sales for each store for the following year.
Model the effects of markdowns on holiday weeks.
Provide recommended actions based on the insights drawn, with prioritization placed on the largest business impact.
